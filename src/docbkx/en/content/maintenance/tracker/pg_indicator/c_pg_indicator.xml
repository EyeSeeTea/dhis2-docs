    <title>About program indicators</title>
    <para>Program indicators are expressions based on data elements and attributes of tracked
        entities which can be used to calculate values based on a formula. Program indicators
        consist of an aggregation type, an analytics type, an expression and a filter.</para>
    <para>Program indicators are evaluated based on the assigned aggregation type, expression and
        filter. The order of evaluation is:</para>

                                        boundary relates to the end of the aggregate reporting
                                        period or the start of the aggregate reporting

                                    <para>Offset period by amount: In some cases, for example cohort
                                        analytics, the boundary should be offset relative to the
                                        aggregate reporting period when running pivots and reports.
                                        The offset period by amount is used to move the current
                                        boundary either back(negative) or forward(positive) in time.
                                        The amount and period type together will determine how big
                                        the offset will be. An example can be when making a simple
                                        enrollment cohort porgram indicator for a 1 year cohort, it
                                        might be enough to offset each boundary of the program

                            the calculation of the indicator. I.e. the filter is applied to the set
                            of events before the indicator expression is being evaluated. The filter
                            must evaluate to either true or false. It filter is applied to each
                            individual event. If the filter evaluates to true then the event is
                            included later in the expression evaluation, if not it is ignored. The

                            multiple data elements must be a specific value, or that specific
                            attributes must have numerical values less or greater than a
